# What is system design?
System design is the process of defining the elements of a system, as well as their interactions and relationships, in order to satisfy a set of specified requirements.
  - It involves taking a problem statement, breaking it down into smaller components and designing each component to work together effectively to achieve the overall goal of the system.
  - This process typically includes analyzing the current system (if any) and determining any deficiencies, creating a detailed plan for the new system, and testing the design to ensure
    that it meets the requirements.
  - It is an iterative process that may involve multiple rounds of design, testing, and refinement.
